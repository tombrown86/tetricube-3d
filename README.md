# tetricube-3d

REAL 3D tetris using 2D canvas context and does it's own 3D rendering.

This is "REAL 3D" because the cubes gather in the centre of a cube and the shapes can approach from any of it's 6 sides.

Unlike boring 2D tetris, I've made it easier by allowing the user move around the cube to get the best view.

Actually, I'll be honest - it's pretty difficult! However, it's not so much about the game but rather the 3D engine.
